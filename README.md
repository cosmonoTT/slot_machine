# Slot Machine

## Browser-based Slot Machine game
For my first project I decided to tackle making a browser based slot machine game. My goal for this project was to have a clean yet colorful take on a modern slot machine game, with simple animations and sounds to add to the user experience.

## Images

## Technologies used
My game utilizes CSS, Javascript, and HTML.
- CSS and HTML:
    - My us of CSS and HTML for this project is somewhat minimal, as a majority of my focus for this project is Javascript.
- Javascript:
    - My game is almost entirely comprised of Javascript, I was able to use Javascript to hold my images as variables, and I was able to control the display settings of HTML elements using conditional statements.
    - The animations were created for my game entirely using JQuery to manipulate DOM elements.

## Getting Started
Users begin my game with 50 points and with a wager of 1 point. I recommend playing with sound on.

## Next Steps
One of the only features that I wasn't able to implement was a more advanced animation for everytime the slot machine is played. I would have preferred a more dynamic animation, but it ended up being a bit of a lofty goal due to my current expertise surrounding CSS animations.
